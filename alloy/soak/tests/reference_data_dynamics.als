module soak/tests/reference_data_dynamics

/*
 * SOAK tier — the VERSION-DYNAMICS LEMMA root (DT-023 Q-D / DT-024, closing pass 7c):
 * prove the reference-data lifecycle + pin laws WIDE here, ONCE — multiple items and
 * affiliates each with a REAL multi-version log (Creates, Updates, Deletes coexisting) —
 * so every other soak root may take the CREATED-ONLY SLICE (each reference-data subject
 * carries exactly its Create; no Update/Delete atoms) with this root as the justification.
 * The slice is sound because the operational modules' laws read reference data only
 * through the pin/liveness API verified here; version dynamics never interleave with
 * operational choreography except through those reads. `make soak` only.
