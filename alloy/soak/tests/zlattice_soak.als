module soak/tests/zlattice_soak

/*
 * SOAK tier (DT-022 TQ-5): the GLOBAL exclusivity-lattice row at WIDENED scopes — the
 * heaviest soak check by far (the gate's tuned form ran ~14 min at cut 4); deliberately
 * LAST in the sequential soak order. Composes the three holder contracts (mocks), the
 * gate root's shape (tests/pool_lattice.als) with +1 on every holder census and widened
 * abstract parents. `make soak` only; never on the push path.
