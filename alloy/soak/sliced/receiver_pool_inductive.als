module soak/sliced/receiver_pool_inductive

/*
 * E7 (DT-024 plan-of-record) — inductiveness check of `linePoolExclusiveWhileLive`.
 *
 * SHAPE: the classic invariant proof, not a trace soak. The candidate inductive
 * invariant is per-tick:
 *   e7Inv[t] = linePoolProvenanceAt[t] (line-held pool = some committed Receive's
 *              payload — the receiver-side MIRROR of the peers' published
 *              poolProvenance/holdingProvenance) ∧ loneHolderAt[t] (facet (i) slice).
 * Obligations:
 *   e7_slice_faithful — the per-tick slice conjunction ≡ the published law (traceability).
 *   e7_base — e7Inv at the first tick (havoc-free), trivial by empty history.
 *   e7_step — e7Inv[t] preserved by ANY single real step (arbitrary pre-states supplied
 *             by the HavocLineOcc seed kind; guards + frames + chaining stay intact).
 *   e7_law  — e7Inv[t] ∧ genesis premise ∧ peer contracts (mock facts) ⇒ law slice at t,
 *             STATE-LOCAL (no trace reasoning; rests on resolve = eId.id + EntityIdIsKey).
 * Together: base + step give e7Inv at every tick of every real trace; e7_law converts
 * that to the law — replacing trace-length-scaling search with state-local checks.
 *
 * HAVOC SOUNDNESS: HavocLineOcc extends the line-log SubjectOcc with NO effect frame,
 * so its post is an arbitrary well-formed ReceivingLineState (types-file extensionality
 * and ref-integrity facts still apply — they are record-level well-formedness we keep).
 * Seeds are forced committed and strictly BEFORE every real line occurrence; e7_step
 * excludes steps INTO a seed tick. All admission/effect witnessing in the implementation
 * is per-kind, so seeds are swept only by `chained`/`commitAlwaysAccepts` (both benign).
