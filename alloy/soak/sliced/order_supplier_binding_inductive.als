module soak/sliced/order_supplier_binding_inductive

/*
 * E7 generalization ladder, rung 3b (DT-024 plan-of-record, priority 3 — the FREEZE
 * FAMILY): inductiveness check of order `supplierBindingFrozen` (C9), on the proven
 * receiver_pool_inductive template (the conventions/inductive_invariant idiom).
 *
 * SHAPE — A PER-OCCURRENCE LAW. The published law quantifies over OCCURRENCES, not ticks:
 *   committed[o] ∧ some oPre[o] ∧ oPre[o].sStatus ≠ DRAFT ⇒ oPost[o].sSupplier = oPre[o].sSupplier.
 * Its per-tick slice is the clause over the occurrences AT that tick, and the slice IS the
 * candidate invariant — a frame law carries no state-shaped strengthening (nothing
 * accumulates). The four-obligation chain therefore reads:
 *   e7_slice_faithful — the per-tick slices ∧-compose to the published law (traceability).
 *   e7_base — the slice at the first tick (havoc-free; genesis reads no pre).
 *   e7_step — THE SUBSTANTIVE OBLIGATION: the real occurrence at t2 satisfies the clause
 *             from an ARBITRARY pre-state at t (HavocOrderOcc seeds) — the direct
 *             guard/frame theorem the plan-of-record row anticipates: UpdateSupplier and
 *             ResetToSupplier refuse RFrozen off-DRAFT; every other kind carries sSupplier
 *             (sameOrderButStatus / the explicit frames / the Delete tombstone).
 *   e7_law  — invariant ⇒ law slice: the identity for a per-occurrence law, kept so the
 *             chain reads uniformly across the ladder.
 * Unlike the exclusivity rows, the seeds' arbitrary posts are exercised DIRECTLY as the
 * step's pre-states — the slice references no history, so no witness conjunct filters
 * seeded states out of the antecedent.
 *
 * HAVOC SOUNDNESS: HavocOrderOcc extends the order-log SubjectOcc with NO effect frame —
 * its post is an arbitrary well-formed OrderState. Seeds are forced committed and strictly
 * BEFORE every real order occurrence; e7_step excludes steps INTO a seed tick. The order
 * module's admission/effect witnessing and its pin-currency facts (BindingPinCurrency,
 * AssigneePinCurrency) all name their kinds, so seeds are swept only by olog/chained +
 * commitAlwaysAccepts — benign (the receiving precedent). The law is UNCONDITIONAL in the
 * contracts (guard/frame-derived, no genesis premise) — nothing to thread.
 *
 * NIGHTWATCH 2026-08-27: base-scope shake-out by day; _w then _s gates in the night window.
