module soak/sliced/receiver_captured_facts_inductive

/*
 * E7 generalization ladder, rung 3d (DT-024 plan-of-record, priority 3 — the FREEZE
 * FAMILY): inductiveness check of receiving `capturedFactsFrozen` (C3, §8.3.4/§8.3.5), on
 * the proven receiver_pool_inductive template (the conventions/inductive_invariant idiom).
 * Sibling of order_supplier_binding_inductive — read that header for the per-occurrence
 * shape; this file repeats only what differs.
 *
 * THE LAW: committed[o] ∧ some rlPre[o] ∧ rlPre[o].sStatus ≠ RL_RECEIVING ⇒ the ten-field
 * captured-facts cluster (expectation, counts, rejection reason, note, birth pins, and the
 * attribution MEMBERSHIP) carried over. Guard/frame-derived: the capture mutators
 * (UpdateReceivingLine / Append- / RemoveAttribution) refuse RFrozen off-RECEIVING, Receive
 * refuses RBadState off-RECEIVING (the freeze instant reads RECEIVING), and the
 * post-freeze kinds (RecordDelivery / ReleaseLine) carry the cluster (sameLineCapture +
 * the membership frame). UNCONDITIONAL in the contracts — nothing to thread. Seeds:
 * HavocLineOcc on the line log — the SAME seed kind receiver_pool_inductive proved sound on
 * this log (the pairing facts AttachComposesWithAppend / DetachComposesWithRemove /
 * ReceiveFansOutActuals and the pin-currency facts all name their kinds).
 *
 * Cone: the receiving_soak cone verbatim (ten mocks) — the same assurance perimeter as
 * `soak_rcv_capturedFactsFrozen`, the row this rung is to supersede.
 *
 * NIGHTWATCH 2026-08-27: base-scope shake-out by day; _w then _s gates in the night window.
