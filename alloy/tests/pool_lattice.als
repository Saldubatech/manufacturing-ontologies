module tests/pool_lattice

/*
 * THE GLOBAL EXCLUSIVITY-LATTICE ROW (§8.5.3) — the whole-system pairwise-disjointness
 * check, CHECK-ONLY (no owning module, so it never joins any `guarantees`/mock). It
 * composes the three holder modules' CONTRACTS (their mocks): each module's own lattice
 * row is assumed (kanban `poolExclusiveWhileLive`; demand `holdingExclusiveWhileLive`;
 * receiving `linePoolExclusiveWhileLive` — the latter two premise-conditional), and this
 * root verifies the rows COMPOSE into global exclusivity under the one genesis premise —
 * a contract-composition validation, not an implementation discharge (those live in each
 * module's own tier).
 *
 * DEDICATED ROOT (solver-budget confinement — the demand_reset/order_received precedent):
 * `tests/system.als` composes the live-entity implementations and would inflate every
 * existing command with the receiving + demand + order cones; the global row rides its own
 * system-tier root over MOCKS instead.
 *
 * `receivingPoolGenesis` (the widest premise — its clauses cover every attach kind all
 * three rows mention) structurally implies `demandPoolGenesis`, so one antecedent serves.
