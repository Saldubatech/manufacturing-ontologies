# Working with the Alloy model — `alloy/`

Agent + contributor guide for the Alloy side of the project. The model is the
**behavioral / model-finding** model, grounded in the public standard ontologies cached
for reference in `../owl/` (BFO/IOF/QUDT — source-of-truth, not maintained here). The
tree mirrors the system's **functional decomposition**.

## Structure & filing rule

- **Domain → directory, Module → directory, one owning module per entity.** The
  **module** is the unit of modeling/development: each module is a directory
  `<domain>/<module>/` holding its files and a `tests/` subdirectory. **Module shape (DT-017,
  the standard):** four role files — `<module>_types.als` (naked sigs + reified observables +
  read API + definitional facts + the PUBLIC OPERATION SURFACE — Action kinds, Reason taxonomy,
  per-role read API; the Action sigs ARE the behavioral contract surface, semantics stay in the
  implementation; what any consumer may see), `<module>_contracts.als` (the
  published laws as named predicates — curated, few and strong), `<module>_implementation.als`
  (the machinery + the bridge facts deriving the observables), `<module>_mock.als` (asserts the
  contract; what consumer UNIT roots open — never together with the implementation,
  lint-guarded). Internal files below the role files are fine (transitions.als, uom.als — the
  types-cone weight is part of the interface, keep specialty vocabularies separate). Suites
  split into `tests/unit/` (implementation vs peers' MOCKS — `make check-units`, the dev loop)
  and `tests/integration/` (real implementations composed — `make check-integration`, the gate
  tier); `tests/*.als` directly is fine for single-tier modules. A child entity lives in its parent's module (ItemSupply in
  `item/` — declared in `item_types.als`; BusinessRole in `business_affiliate/`). Module paths therefore carry the
  module segment: `module reference_data/item/item_types`, `open resources/kanban_card/kanban_card`.
- **Every defined concept carries a glossary doc-comment.** Immediately above each
  `sig`/`enum`, a `/** Term — one-line glossary definition. */` block (the
  type-level "description"; Alloy has no sig annotations, so this is the convention).
  It is inert to the analyzer and extractable (sig name → definition).
- **Two non-domain layers (DT-001.12):** `meta/` (the model of the model — "how do we model?") and
  `shared/` (domain-neutral vocabulary — "what do all domains speak?"). **Layer law (lint-enforced,
  `make check-layering`, part of `check-alloy`):** `meta` never opens `shared`; `shared` opens `meta`
  freely and never a domain; domains open both. Discriminator: generic/parameterized machinery = `meta`;
  an *instantiation* with concrete vocabulary = `shared` (or the domain, when the vocabulary is
  domain-owned — cf. `uom_collapse`). `shared/` is a **per-level pattern**: any directory level may carry
  a `shared/` subdirectory for elements reused across that level's members (e.g. `reference_data/shared/`),
  with a promotion path upward as usefulness widens.
- **START HERE — `meta/profiles/` (DT-012):** pre-packaged modeling profiles adopted as a unit: `baseline` (P0 — kernel only), **`domain_log` (P1 — THE DEFAULT: stateful log anatomy + `groupAxioms ∧ orderAxioms` as FACTS)**, `timed_log` (P2 — + `Timed`/instant axis). **Opening a profile IS the opt-in** — premises transit to every root in the cone; every domain module opens exactly one profile; markers (`P_*` atoms) show adoption in instances; `make profiles` prints the per-root map. À la carte composition from the base modules is the advanced path (the opt-in catalog: workbook design/meta/index.md).
- **`meta/` is not a domain — it is a PRODUCT for domain modelers (DT-013).** Sophistication inside
  (algebras, time logics) is fine; the exported surface must be a well-defined, ready-to-use
  abstraction. Every new/changed capability ships with: an **abstraction sentence** (one header line,
  modeler vocabulary, no internal terms), task-shaped export names + named premises with a one-line
  "assume when…", a cookbook example + kit/profile integration, and its suite + catalog. A domain
  concept expressible only via the internals is a kit defect — open a DT (the ex18 test). Canonical
  statement: workbook `modeling/meta-design-contract.md`. It holds modeling machinery:
  - `meta/kernel.als` — identity + the `Entity`/`Scoped` bound, `EntityId`, soft-ref `resolve`, cross-tenant isolation (DT-001.02, implemented).
  - `meta/state_machine/machine.als` — generic FSM framework reifying common-module's `StateEngine` (DT-003): `State`/`Signal`/`Guard`/`Transition`/`StateMachine` + once-stated well-formedness/determinism FACTS + checkable `allStatesReachable`/`liveSignals`/`firedInto`. Concrete machines extend `State`/`Signal` and pin a `StateMachine` atom.
  - `meta/scalar/scalar.als` — the foundational numeric primitive `Scalar` (an abstract decimal: `splus`/`smul`/`sneg`, `SZero`/`SOne`, and the `ringAxioms` PREMISE — not a global fact). Its own module so every quantitative layer shares one number type; concrete bounded fixed-point realization in `meta/keyed_value_algebra/scalar_int.als`. Design: `design/meta/kernel/scalar.md`; practice: `modeling/scalar-arithmetic.md`.
  - `meta/keyed_value_algebra/keyed_monoid.als` — keyed additive ℤ-module reifying common-module's `MultiMoney` (DT-005): a value is a normal-form map `key -> lone Scalar` (`add`/`scale`/`negate`/`zero`); add same-key sums, different keys widen, zero-nets collapse. Opens `meta/scalar` for `Scalar`. Instantiate `MultiMoney = Currency -> lone Scalar`, `MultiQuantity = Unit -> lone Scalar`.
  - `meta/keyed_value_algebra/keyed_order.als` — optional order/sign/equality extension (DT-005): a posited linear order on `Scalar` (`orderAxioms` premise — a true order can't be finite + ring-compatible, so it's assumed) gives the component-wise partial order `lte`, sign `classify` (ZERO/POSITIVE/NEGATIVE/INDETERMINATE), and `semanticEq` (EQUAL/UNEQUAL/UNDETERMINED). Heavily commented for teaching.
  - `meta/examples/` — **the modeling cookbook**: runnable, `make`-verified pattern recipes on a neutral Hotel domain, plus a UML/FP Rosetta table. **Learning or refreshing a pattern? Start at `meta/examples/README.md`.** Files are `exNN_*.als` (the `ex` prefix is required — module path components can't start with a digit). New `meta` machinery ships with an example here.
  - `meta/time/{instant,time,duration}.als` — the time substrate (DT-001.03, DT-010), split by DEPENDENCY COST: `instant` is the **bare axis** (`Instant` + total order + `atOrBefore`/`earlierThan`/`earliest`/`latest` + `TimeInterval`/`within`) — what `meta/occurrence` (and hence the whole action/log cone) opens, split out 2026-07-02 because the metric below is ARITY-4 and **Kodkod cannot represent arity 4 once the universe exceeds ~215 atoms** (domain log universes routinely do); `time` opens instant and adds the ABSTRACT period machinery (`PeriodSpec{closes}`/`endOfPeriod`/`samePeriod` under the `calendarAxioms` premise — the real-world binding `PeriodUnit`/`TimeZone`/`CalendarSpec` is `shared/time/calendar`, DT-001.12 earmark fulfilled) and the instant→duration metric (`TimeMetric.span`/`durationBetween` under `durationAxioms`); `duration` is the standalone, totally ordered `Duration` value type, kept separate so value-object users (`shared/values`, `ItemSupply.averageLeadTime`) depend on neither the calendar nor the metric.
  - `meta/model_time/model_time.als` — **model time** (DT-001.03): the ordinal/causal axis `Tick` (a reified total order via `util/ordering[Tick]`; causal vocabulary `precedes`/`follows`/`notAfter`). Distinct *kind* from domain time — carries no magnitude/wall-clock, only succession. NOT the Alloy 6 `var`/trace (the occurrence log must be a queryable, stampable atom set).
  - `meta/occurrence/occurrence.als` — the **two-clock bridge**: `abstract sig Occurrence { tick: one Tick, note: lone String, arche: one Occurrence }` + `OneOccurrencePerTick` + `ArcheOriginPrecedes` — **`arche` = the ORIGIN identity on every occurrence (DT-029 E1, 2026-09-03; TOTAL since MP's D13 ruling A the same day): the immediate caller's row (a callee row cites the caller's RESERVE), SELF-INITIATED = the self-loop `o.arche = o` (`selfInitiated`; the runtime's NOT-NULL own-id column maps to it by identity); uniqueness per (arche, SUBJECT) is `meta/subject_log`'s ADOPTED `archeUniquePerSubject` / guard condition `archeDuplicate` (typed refusal `RDuplicateArche` in `meta/intent_log/semantics`); a row citing a self-minted row on its own subject is a duplicate by construction, so chains never cite their own originator** — MINIMAL (DT-011): the `note` is the inert occurrence-level free-text annotation (MP unification ruling 2026-08-10 — a built-in `String`, ZERO atoms in commands without literals; no law may read its content); the domain-time stamp is the OPT-IN subset extension `meta/occurrence/timed.als` (`Timed in Occurrence { at: one Instant }` + the `clocksAligned` **premise**; forward-monotone; *not* assuming it = backdating) — the only module naming both clocks (modeling-conventions §3.3). DT-006's operation occurrences `extend Occurrence` and opt kinds into `Timed` where wall-clock reads matter.
  - `meta/action/{outcome,action}.als` — **Action** framework (DT-006, Layer 1): an `Action extends Occurrence` performed `by` a `Principal` (actor) with **`bindings: set univ`** — its **binding environment**, the quantifier prefix of the guarded formula ("∃ x such that guard(x) then effect(x)"; a binding may be an Entity, a Value, or any model element; derived per kind from named, TYPED binding fields — decision 2026-07-01, `sig Instance` deleted) — bracketed by an **admission guard** (pre-projection) and a **commit guard** (post-projection), with `Decision = Accepted | Rejected{because: Reason}`; the three outcomes are named preds that PARTITION Action (`committed`/`refusedAtAdmission`/`refusedAtCommit`; `refusalReasons` collects a refusal's why). Guards are made evaluable per kind by the **witnessing pattern** (`admission = Accepted iff <pred>`). **State-as-projection**: NO `World`, no domain `var` — state is a **fold over the committed log prefixes** (`committedBefore[t]` = the strict PRE-projection guards read; `committedUpTo[t]` = the inclusive POST-projection; then `keyed_sum[Occurrence]` for levels / LOCF for last-write-wins); a refused action contributes nothing (rollback is free). The core is state-agnostic; cookbook `ex15` chains guarded actions and queries the projected state. Dynamics (duration/scheduling/serialization) deferred to Layer 2. Design: `design/meta/action/`.
  - `meta/action/stateful.als` — the OPTIONAL snapshot-carrying extension (DT-006 build prep): opaque `Snapshot` (domains extend it with their state record, e.g. the coming `InventoryItemState`; doubles as the future bitemporal version payload) + `StatefulAction { pre, post: lone Snapshot }` + `PostOnlyIfCommitted`. The Effect's visible seat: admission reads `pre` → the kind's value-parameterized transition core constrains `(pre, post)` (Effect witnessing) → commit reads `post`; guard reads are field access, state-at-t is LOCF of records. NAMING: `pre`/`post` — `before`/`after` are Alloy 6 temporal KEYWORDS. Domain chaining is a domain fact and must be UNCONDITIONAL (refused actions still read the real state). Cookbook: `ex17` (folio snapshot chains), `ex18` (the ex16 stack on the full machinery — the InventoryItem-build template).
  - `meta/action/attributed.als` — the OPT-IN actor stamp (DT-011): `Attributed in Action { by: one Principal }` (SUBSET sig — independent opt-ins compose under single inheritance). Without it the kernel/Principal family stays OUT of the action cone; open it for provenance/ABAC (the deferred WriteOff-authorization hook). Kinds opt in with one fact.
  - **Domain modeling? Start at the workbook `modeling/domain-log-kit.md`** — the single entry path (five idioms + extensions + the quantitative bundle); `modeling/solver-limits.md` for the tool folklore (arity-4 ceiling, scopes, JVM hygiene). **Cross-log laws declare a consistency class** assigned by the MATRIX — interaction kind × module boundary, deployment plays NO role (same module + Operation → ATOMIC; different module + Operation → CONVERGENT/OPERATION with the call-first saga shape; Notification → CONVERGENT/NOTIFICATION either way; human-resolvable → RECONCILED — kit §consistency-classes, adopted 2026-07-06) in the contract file header and the design doc; per-class suite obligations in `modeling/verification-conventions.md`. **Naming registers (Occ ruling (c), 2026-07-06):** model sigs keep the `Occ` suffix (occurrence-register marker); product surfaces (design-doc Operations tables, endpoints, wire names) use the bare verb.
  - `meta/principal/principal.als` — **Principal** (a DT-006 foundation): the responsible identity ("who") in provenance. **Fully an `Entity`** (identity `eId`, soft-ref-resolvable) with a unique readable handle `name`; **NOT `Scoped`** (global — sibling of `Scoped`, so tenant-scoping is excluded by typing). `principal` (not `agent`, reserved for the later "acting on behalf of"); `kind` (human/system) deferred. Kept in `meta` (not `shared`): it is a structural part of the action anatomy (`Action.by`), and `meta` may not open `shared`.
  - `meta/intent_log/{semantics,intent_log}.als` — **the INTENT LOG** (DT-027, SAMWISE stream, 2026-08-28): the reusable core of the intent-log pattern for "two logs, one fact" — a module that must act on a PEER module's entity first appends RESERVE to a chain it OWNS keyed by that entity (`intent_log[Key, Sem]`, riding `subject_log`), acts once (call-first), then CONFIRM (citing the peer row) or RELEASE (typed refusal only); competing intents fork on one chain (exclusivity is a THEOREM of the chain guard); recovery is the total `redrive` function of two heads. `Sem` = `HoldSem` (durable custody; TRANSFER + sub-intents with KEEP/CLOSE mode) or `MoveSem` (one-shot movement; the key frees). The peer view and the owner/peer citations are `univ`-typed bindings the applying module ties to its own atoms; the two-arm ATTRIBUTION law (exclusive transition vs additive row citing the intent) lives with the applier — exemplar `conventions/intent_log`, cookbook `ex20`. OPEN RULE: alias the vocabulary (`open meta/intent_log/semantics as sem`) and pass QUALIFIED parameters (`intent_log[CardCycle, sem/HoldSem]`); roots re-open the instance with identical parameters (`knowledge-base/parametric-module-open-parameters.md`).
- **`shared/` — domain-neutral vocabulary** (concrete signatures + instantiations of `meta` machinery; opens `meta` freely, never a domain — DT-001.12):
  - `shared/values.als` — value objects: `Money` (Currency-keyed) and `Quantity` (Unit-keyed) are **instances of the keyed monoid** (`byCurrency`/`byUnit` normal-form maps, DT-005); `PhysicalLocator` (9-level); `Label`. (`Duration` — the ordered elapsed-time value type — stays in `meta/time/duration`; the instant→duration metric in `meta/time`.)
  - `shared/note.als` — `Note`, the pure opaque annotation value for RECORD-carried note fields (`lone Note`/`set Note` on state records; orphan-EXEMPT, the SupplierReference/Q8 precedent; DT-022 cut 6, own module since 2026-08-10). **Deliberately its OWN module, opened ONLY by consumers (order, receiver)** — an inert pure-presence value in `values.als` would ride EVERY domain cone at default scope (see the scope gotcha below). The OCCURRENCE-level note is NOT a `Note`: it is the inert `note: lone String` on the core `Occurrence` (`meta/occurrence`; MP unification ruling 2026-08-10 — runtime counterpart: widen the shared `OccurrenceDto` with an optional `note`, retiring the `OrderOccurrenceDto` fork; see the workbook's model-update-candidates ledger).
  - `shared/measurement/quantity.als` — the **V = Quantity instantiation** of `meta/measurement[V]` (keyed MIN/MAX + `sumIn` via `keyed_sum[Measurement]`, `metricResult` dispatch; DT-008). Lives here, not in `meta`, by the instantiation rule.
  - `shared/certainty/certainty.als` — ordered confidence levels (`LOW<MEDIUM<HIGH`) + staleness-decay rule (decay never raises certainty); DT-010. Time→step mapping pending a time-metric.
  - `shared/x731_state/state.als` — ITU-T X.731 expressed via `meta/state_machine`: three region machines (Operational ∥ Usage ∥ Administrative) + `Resource` host + interlocks as cross-region invariants (DT-003).
  - `shared/std/{bfo,iof,qudt,owl_time}.als` — **boundary stubs** MIREOT'd from the public standards (only terms our entities touch, each with its source IRI). Currently STUBS; DT-002. The standards (BFO/IOF/QUDT) stay source-of-truth as a **read-only reference cache** under `../owl/imports/` (consult via ROBOT) — we no longer maintain an authored OWL ontology; harvested mappings are in the workbook `domain-ontology/additional-info.md`.
  - `shared/time/calendar.als` — CALENDARING (the DT-001.12 earmark, fulfilled): `PeriodUnit` (HOUR/DAY/WEEK), `TimeZone`, `CalendarSpec extends PeriodSpec` binding the abstract meta period machinery to the real world; future `endOfDay`/standard durations/tenant TZs land here.
- Domains: `system reference_data resources procurement shop_access fulfillment operations receiving shipping oam workflows_and_integrations`. Only `reference_data` (Item/ItemSupply — DT-017 four-file, **LOG-CARRIED since DT-023 cut 7a (2026-08-11)**: the simple reference-data lifecycle (`reference_data/shared/lifecycle.als` — RdStatus + the shared `RRetiredRef`) + version PINS (consumers hold `ItemOcc` atoms; the order line's identity `itemPin` IS the frozen descriptor); BusinessAffiliate/BusinessRole — **LOG-CARRIED since DT-023 cut 7b**: versioned role membership (`sRoles`), the `SupplierReference`/`CarrierReference` handles DISSOLVED into pin + role-selector pairs; **StaffMember — `reference_data/staff`, LOG-CARRIED since DT-023 cut 7c** (status-only state, Update omitted as vacuous; tenant-unique `name` stays identity; the order `sAssignee` is a `StaffOcc` pin); Item carries the inventory-tracking `UomScheme`, DT-009 — see `reference_data/item/uom.als` + the multi-unit `collapse` in `reference_data/item/uom_collapse.als`) and `resources` (KanbanCard — the card is the static container + print machine; the CardCycle lifecycle is LOG-CARRIED (DT-015; **DT-017 FOUR-FILE since 2026-07-08**: `kanban_card_{types,contracts,implementation,mock}.als` — the cycle log rides the `meta/subject_log` SPINE with the alias `fun cycle` preserving `o.cycle` reads; seven published laws in the contracts; forward-skip guards over the reified `LifecycleConfig`, closure by withdraw/rollover; the baseline spike archived to `../alloy-sample/kanban_card_baseline/`); InventoryItem — the CANONICAL log-carried module (DT-011) and the DT-017 four-file PILOT: `inventory_item_types.als` (identity-only entity + the InventoryItemState record + the reified observables `stateRel`/`liveTicks` with the stateAt/liveAt read API + the PUBLIC operation surface: fifteen StatefulAction kinds, Reason taxonomy, per-role read API) + `inventory_item_contracts.als` (6 published laws) + `inventory_item_implementation.als` (reason-precise witnessing, chaining, effects, the observable bridge) + `inventory_item_mock.als`, with `transitions.als` (value-parameterized cores) implementation-internal; the frozen var carrier was archived VERBATIM to `../alloy-sample/inventory_item_legacy/` at full parity (2026-07-02; see its README to run it); **InventoryPool** — a Scoped set of InventoryItems under one Item, `resources/inventory_item/inventory_pool.als` (part of the inventory_item module — closely coupled, they evolve together; its `var` membership stays out of the static log cone: only its own root and `tests/system.als` open it), DT-004) have content, plus `metrics.als` in the same module (the DT-007 inventory-count read side — metrics live NEXT TO the entities they measure; `operations/` is reserved for actual manufacturing/logistics operations like assembly or put-away). **`operations` opened 2026-07-06 (DT-016): `operations/demand/`** — DemandItem, the collection-and-collation shim (DT-014 rung 2), the FIRST module born on the `meta/subject_log` spine; four-file + the CONFINED `demand_reset.als` (arity-4 Σ — only its dedicated root opens it); 15 kinds (model names `CreateDemandOcc`/`DeleteDemandOcc`/`StartProductionOcc` dodge flat-namespace collisions; `DS_` status atoms; `dPre`/`dPost` typed record accessors), C/OP call-first commit gates reading the kanban cycle log (consumed as kanban TYPES in the libraries + kanban MOCK in the unit tier since the kanban four-file cut, 2026-07-08). `resources/processing_network` is a four-file STATIC stub (Station/Loop soft-ref targets) + the DT-023 cut 7c retirement LATCH (`retiredAt: lone Tick` + `stationLiveAt`/`loopLiveAt` — OWN atoms per the R2 structural-independence ruling, NOT the reference_data lifecycle; consumer refs stay soft and ungated until the Loop build-out). **`procurement` opened 2026-07-08 (DT-018): `procurement/order/`** — Order/OrderLine, the agreement document at a Source station's boundary (DT-014 rung 3); the FIRST TWO-SUBJECT module (two `subject_log` opens, `olog`/`llog`), four-file + the CONFINED `order_received.als` (the case-wise accumulate reading — a THEOREM of `receiptAccrues`, checked only in its dedicated root); 17 kinds (`CreateOrderOcc`/`CancelOrderOcc`/`CloseOrderOcc`/`DeleteOrderOcc`/`AnnotateOrderOcc` dodge demand's kinds in the flat namespace; `OS_` status atoms; `oPre`/`oPost`/`lPre`/`lPost` accessors); FIRST consumer of `demand_mock` (unit tier) and of `business_affiliate_types` (`SupplierBinding` carries `vendorPin: lone BaOcc` + `vendorRole` since DT-023 cut 7b — the `SupplierReference` handle and its whole closure apparatus DISSOLVED; name-only stays legal, PDEV-241); C/OP gates are ORDER-SIDE ONLY (attach: item RELEASED + unheld; Submit: every serviced item IN_PROCESS), and THE HOLD DIES WITH THE ORDER (`holdingLineOf` requires the parent order live — cancel returns items to the queue). **`receiving` opened at the DT-020 build (cut 4, 2026-08-05): `receiving/receiver/`** — Receiver/ReceivingLine/OrderAttribution, the THREE-SUBJECT module (DT-014 rung 4); delivery pools by ownership-at-genesis (§8.5.3 — the pool-exclusivity lattice), captured-facts freeze incl. the cut-6 `sRejectionReason`/`sNote`, field-wise terminal completeness with the `sInternalNotes` exemption (`AnnotateReceiverOcc`); unit tier vs peer mocks + the lean composed arc root `tests/integration/receiver_arc.als` (real demand machinery). The rest are stubbed (`.gitkeep`).
- **`conventions/` (MP, 2026-07-08): canonical convention EXEMPLARS** — each subdirectory a self-contained mini-model (may open `meta/` + `shared/` ONLY; nothing outside `conventions/` may open one — lint-enforced) demonstrating one adopted convention in its smallest NON-VACUOUS form, with a `tests/` root in the gate. Initial set: `pinning_freezing` (LIVE/PINNED/COPIED against a genuinely mutable target — the drift witness the quasi-static core can't exhibit), `call_first_saga` (C/OP commit gates, legal in-flight, compensation, t-param quiescence), `notification_convergence` (C/NOTIF idempotent listener + missed-window/self-heal/settled trio), `denormalized_observables` (pairwise stored increments + case-wise completeness), `reason_precise_refusals` (the admission-witness idiom + check/witness pairing), `metrics` (read-side as-of cells with a REAL keyed_sum fold — the light cone affords what the core metrics cone cannot; doubles as the DT-013 F2 fold-pinning recipe). Added 2026-08-24: `inductive_invariant` (the E7 state-local proof idiom for time-indexed exclusivity laws — havoc seeds + base/step/law obligations; DT-024). Design walkthroughs: workbooks `design/conventions/<kebab-name>/`. See `conventions/README.md`.
- The original throwaway X.731 behavioral spike (Loop/Station/Operator/Job/InventoryLot + 8-state lifecycle) was archived to `../alloy-sample/kanban_sim/` when the real code-faithful `KanbanCard` landed (DT-001.08). It is not in the `make check-alloy` set; see its README.

## ⚠️ Naming: snake_case, never `-` or `.`

Alloy module names cannot contain `-` or `.` (both are **syntax errors**), and the
`module <path>` declaration **must equal the file's path under `alloy/`** (Alloy
strips it to compute the project root, then resolves every `open` from there).
Therefore:

- Directories and files use **snake_case** (`reference_data/`, `kanban_card.als`),
  even though the functional domain canonical names are kebab-case
  (`reference-data` ↔ `reference_data`). This overrides the workspace kebab-case
  convention **inside `alloy/` only**.
- Every file declares `module <path-under-alloy>` (e.g.
  `module resources/kanban_card/kanban_card`,
  `module resources/kanban_card/tests/kanban_card`, `module meta/std/iof`).
- `open` uses paths-from-`alloy/`: `open meta/x731_state/state`,
  `open reference_data/item/item`.

## Library vs. root (where commands live)

- **Library files** (`meta/…`, `<domain>/<module>/<file>.als`) carry all
  model-defining elements: `sig`, `fact`, `fun`, and co-located checkable `assert`/`pred`.
- **Only root files carry `run`/`check`.** A root does **not** execute commands
  from the modules it opens. Roots are the `tests/*.als` files.
- Open a **root** in the GUI / pass it to `exec`; never a library module.

## Tests & command tiers

- Tests live in a **`tests/` subdirectory**: per-module suite at
  `<domain>/<module>/tests/<file>.als`; domain-level cross-module suite at
  `<domain>/tests/<domain>.als` (named after the domain — avoid the overloaded word
  "aggregate"); whole-system at `tests/system.als`. (NOT `*.test.als` — dotted module
  names are illegal.)
- **Command-name tiers** (for wildcard selection): `unit_*` (module), `dom_*`
  (domain-level), `sys_*` (system). New commands follow this; relocated
  commands kept their original names (`showSimulation`, `X731Consistency`).
- **No master root** aggregates suites — the Makefile iterates `tests/` roots.
- **Co-change rule (STRICT).** Every model change ships with the required verification
  changes **in the same change set**: commands/`expect`s added or updated in the affected
  roots, and the root's catalog doc in the workbook (`design/**/verification*`) trued. A
  model edit that changes verified behavior without touching its suites and catalogs is
  an **incomplete change** — new modules get a suite + catalog before they land.

## Running

From the repo root: `make check-alloy` (all test roots — THE GATE), `make check-units` (all
roots except `tests/integration/` — the DT-017 dev loop), `make check-integration` (only the
integration tiers), `make check-examples` (the cookbook), `make test-unit`, `make test-sys`,
`make alloy` (GUI). Direct: `java -jar tools/alloy.jar exec -c "<name|glob|*>" -o /tmp/ao -f <root>.als`.
Interpreting: `run` SAT = instance found; `check` UNSAT = assertion holds.

## `fact` vs `assert` vs `pred`

- `fact` — inviolable structural invariant, always enforced (use sparingly).
- `assert`+`check` — property to verify (counterexample if wrong); most tests.
- `pred`+`run` — scenario existence / "this works".

## Gotchas

1. **No `-` or `.` in module names** (snake_case; see above).
2. **Commands run only from the opened root**; library `run`/`check` won't fire.
3. `module <path>` must match the file's path under `alloy/`.
4. Scope must exceed the atoms a predicate forces (shared abstract supertypes
   share the scope); don't put a numeric scope on a `one sig`.
5. Open a root, not a submodule, in the GUI.
6. **Reified state machines (DT-003) need explicit per-sig scopes.** `State`/
   `Signal` are abstract and fully partitioned into `one sig`s, and the no-orphan
   facts pin `Transition`/`Guard`, so each command must size those families exactly
   (e.g. kanban: `but 16 State, 20 Signal, 20 Transition, 2 StateMachine, 0 Guard`).
   `sig` is a reserved keyword — never a variable name (use `sg`).
7. **Inert pure-presence values (`Note`-class) must never ride the default scope**
   (MP ruling, 2026-08-10). A value the laws read only for presence/equality (no
   fields, no inter-atom relations) contributes nothing to counterexamples beyond
   add/remove/replace — `2 <Sig>` exhibits all three; anything more only inflates
   solve time. Two obligations: (a) commands in a cone carrying such a value pin it
   (`2 Note`); (b) such values get their OWN shared module opened only by consumers —
   never a seat in `shared/values.als`, which is in every domain cone (the occurrence
   note dodges atoms entirely: it is a built-in `String`, zero atoms in any command
   without string literals).

`modeling/`, `design-topics/`, `design/`) → `modeling/alloy-repository-structure.md`,
`design-topics/dt-001-alloy-directory-structure.md` (layout, DT-001.01 decided),
`design-topics/dt-002-bridging-owl-standard-models.md` (vendoring),
`modeling/modeling-conventions.md` (DAG/aggregation/refs/tight-by-default),
`design/reference-data/index.md` +
`design/resources/kanban-card/kanban-cards-entities.md` (code-authoritative entity
inventories). `meta/kernel` is implemented; the reference_data slice and the
code-faithful `KanbanCard` are modeled. Next: populate `meta/std` (DT-002), enrich
fields, and decide the event-history/bitemporal depth (DT-001.03).
