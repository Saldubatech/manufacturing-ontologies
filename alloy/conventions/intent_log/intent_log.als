/*
 * CONVENTION EXEMPLAR — THE INTENT-LOG PATTERN (DT-027, SAMWISE; origin SPEARHEAD-D3, chartered by
 * MINESWEEPER-Q6, 2026-08-28). Canon: the demand cycle-claim log ruled for P3-I4 (chain A) and the
 * identity-keyed pool movements ruled in SAMWISE-S1 (chain B).
 *
 * THE CONVENTION: a module that must produce an effect in a PEER module's log ("two logs, one
 * fact") first appends RESERVE to an intent log it OWNS whose subject IS the contended peer
 * entity, acts on the peer ONCE (call-first), then appends CONFIRM (citing the peer's committed
 * row) or RELEASE (on the peer's TYPED refusal — never on a timeout). Competing intents are forks
 * on one chain; the peer keeps NO holder knowledge; recovery is the re-drive function of two heads
 * (meta/intent_log `redrive`). What the module `meta/intent_log/intent_log[Key, Sem]` cannot know
 * — and this exemplar shows — is the ATTRIBUTION LAW binding each CONFIRM / RELEASE's `peerView`
 * to the real peer head. Since DT-029 E2 BOTH arms attribute BY CITATION — the peer row's `arche` names the
 * intent it fulfils and the module derives moved-by-this from it (`claim/citationView`, adopted); what the
 * exemplar still supplies is the RESIDUAL split (absent / unmoved / moved-otherwise when not cited). The arms
 * differ in the peer's transition, not in attribution:
 *   - the EXCLUSIVE arm (HOLD chain): the peer act is a transition only one taker can make (`take` on a free
 *     Cart); an UNCITED take (the UI's) reads moved-OTHERWISE on a TAKEN cart — DT-027 §7's uncited-accept
 *     cell — so the owner RELEASEs and detaches instead of confirming; the named PREMISE `takeOnlyByClaimants`
 *     (takes cite their live claim) is what the exclusive-arm LAW rides, never attribution;
 *   - the ADDITIVE arm (MOVEMENT chain): the peer act stacks (`pour` into a Vat) and the peer head cannot
 *     tell one pour from another — only the citation can (`arche` = the RESERVE it fulfils; the runtime's
 *     `arche_id` column + partial unique index, SAMWISE-S1); a late pour citing a RELEASEd intent is
 *     DETECTABLE, and a reversal is itself a new movement intent naming the row it reverses.
 *
 * THE CAST: a Porter (owner) claims Carts (exclusive peer, HOLD) and pours into Vats (additive
 * peer, MOVEMENT). Carts and Vats keep their own logs and never mention porters. Both peers share
 * this file for compactness; in core models they live in DIFFERENT modules and the peer act is a
 * request/reply operation — the design doc carries the mapping.
