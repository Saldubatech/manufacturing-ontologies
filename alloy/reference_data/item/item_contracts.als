module reference_data/item/item_contracts

/*
 * ITEM — CONTRACTS (DT-017). The module's laws as NAMED predicates: everything a consumer may
 * rely on, and nothing else. types + contracts = the DOMAIN statement of this module.
 *
 * Since the DT-023 cut 7a log conversion the laws split by NATURE:
 *  - CONTENT laws (supply ownership, UoM ownership, supplier-ref soundness) remain AXIOMS —
 *    nothing deeper derives them; the implementation asserts them as facts, exactly as the
 *    static form did (the degenerate-form heritage, now content-only).
 *  - LIFECYCLE laws (Create-first, retirement-terminal) are THEOREMS of the guards + effects,
 *    proven in the suite (check, UNSAT = holds) and assumable by consumers via the mock.
 *  - The CHAINING law is the spine's, adopted as fact and re-published here so consumer unit
 *    roots get the log shape from the mock.
