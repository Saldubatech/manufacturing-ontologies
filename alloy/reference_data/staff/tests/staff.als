/*
 * STAFF — module suite (DT-022 TQ-7(b) cut 6; LOG-CARRIED since DT-023 cut 7c). The
 * identity law keeps its check + boundary witness; the lifecycle gains the arc/shape/
 * refusal/pin family (the BA suite's shape, minus roles and minus Update — status-only
 * state, Update omitted as vacuous).
