module reference_data/business_affiliate/business_affiliate_contracts

/*
 * BUSINESS AFFILIATE — CONTRACTS (DT-017). The module's laws as NAMED predicates: everything
 * a consumer may rely on, and nothing else. types + contracts = the DOMAIN statement.
 *
 * Since the DT-023 cut 7b log conversion the laws split by NATURE (the item precedent):
 *  - CONTENT laws (role ownership) remain AXIOMS — nothing deeper derives them; the
 *    implementation asserts them as facts (the degenerate-form heritage, now content-only).
 *  - LIFECYCLE laws (Create-first, retirement-terminal) are THEOREMS of the guards + effects,
 *    proven in the suite (check, UNSAT = holds) and assumable by consumers via the mock.
 *  - The CHAINING law is the spine's, adopted as fact and re-published here so consumer unit
 *    roots get the log shape from the mock.
