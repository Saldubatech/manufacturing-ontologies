/*
 * BUSINESS AFFILIATE — IMPLEMENTATION (DT-017). Integration roots open this file to get the
 * REAL module.
 *
 * Since the DT-023 cut 7b log conversion the module is NO LONGER static-degenerate: the
 * lifecycle machinery (chaining, reason-precise admission, effects) lives here, and the
 * contract's lifecycle laws are THEOREMS of it (proven in tests/business_affiliate.als).
 * The CONTENT law (role ownership — C1) remains an asserted axiom.
