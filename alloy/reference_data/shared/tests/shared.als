// reference_data/shared — the DOMAIN-level shared module (the meta-equivalent at domain scope): holds
// cross-module verifications (and any domain-shared super-classes, when they arise) that belong to no
// single module. Here: the reference chain Item → ItemSupply → vendor PIN → BusinessRole(VENDOR)
// within a BusinessAffiliate VERSION, which spans the item and business_affiliate modules.
// DT-023 cut 7b: the chain's middle is the pin + role-selector pair (the SupplierReference handle
// DISSOLVED); resolution reads became version reads — dangling is unrepresentable by typing.

// A fully-linked single-tenant instance exists — the whole chain is satisfiable (not over-constrained).
