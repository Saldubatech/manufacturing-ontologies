module receiving/receiver/receiver_contracts

/*
 * RECEIVER — CONTRACTS (DT-020/DT-017). The module's laws as NAMED predicates — curated few
 * and strong, each tagged with its consistency class per the kit MATRIX (interaction kind ×
 * module boundary; deployment plays no role):
 *
 *  - Receiver ↔ ReceivingLine ↔ OrderAttribution laws are SAME-MODULE (all three subjects
 *    live here) → ATOMIC invariants. The same-module compositions (line birth + attribution
 *    genesis; the Receive `sActual` fan-out; detach + tombstone) are rendered as PAIRING
 *    ENFORCEMENT FACTS in the implementation and are deliberately NOT in `guarantees`
 *    (the createRecordsAtomically precedent, L9: no mock consumer relies on the pairing,
 *    and publishing it would force attribution machinery into every consumer universe).
 *  - Receiving ↔ resources (item genesis, the pool) and receiving ↔ demand (the distribute
 *    saga closing in `sDeliveries`) are DIFFERENT-MODULE Operations → CONVERGENT/OPERATION
 *    with the CALL-FIRST shape: the caller drives the resources/demand legs FIRST, the
 *    receiving guard is the commit gate. In-flight intermediates are LEGAL (a committed
 *    demand-side PD not yet appended to `sDeliveries` is the ordinary §8.1.3 window; the
 *    PD's reconciliation handle serves orphan recovery — runtime, out of model).
 *  - Receiving never posts to the ORDER: the order's accrual rides the DEMAND edge
 *    (RecordProduction → receiptAccrues, C/NOTIF — the order module's laws; nothing here).
 *
 * THE EXCLUSIVITY LATTICE (§8.5.3): `linePoolExclusiveWhileLive` is this module's lattice
 * row — line pools not shared among lines (own-kind: guard-derived, unconditional) and not
 * held by live cycles or live demand holdings (cross-kind: derived from the guards PLUS the
 * GENESIS PREMISE `receivingPoolGenesis` below — §8.5.3's "guard-and-genesis-derived
 * theorems"). The premise is the model's rendering of the runtime mint discipline (every
 * holder kind mints its pool inside its own act — a fresh mint can never collide with any
 * existing pool); it is a named ASSUMPTION (the groupAxioms/orderAxioms premise mechanism),
 * NEVER a fact — a runtime discipline breach stays representable (premise false), watched
 * by the §8.5.3 integrity monitoring (PDEV-1424), not legislated away.
