/*
 * UNIT suite for the receiving module (DT-020 cut 4; THREE subjects on the spine). Every
 * peer state this suite needs rides the peers' MOCKS (contracts only — no peer machinery),
 * so demand/cycle/order records are cheap to instantiate at whatever status a scenario
 * needs; the POOL rides the real inventory_pool (single-file module, part of the types
 * cone — the kanban precedent). Machine pins: the PRINT machine (5 State, 8 Signal,
 * 8 Transition, 1 StateMachine, 0 Guard) rides the kanban types open; 5 Int. NB `for N`
 * silently caps the TOTALS of the ABSTRACT parents — Snapshot (records across ALL subjects
 * in this heavy cone) and the occurrence pool: heavy traces pin Snapshot, Tick, and
 * EntityId explicitly (the 2026-07-06 folklore). The order-cone value sigs
 * (SupplierBinding, Confirmation, …) are pinned to 0 wherever no order document
 * participates; attribution `orderLineRef`s may legally DANGLE (soft refs) in scenarios
 * that do not read through them. CHECK SCOPES pin the abstract parents EXPLICITLY, sized
 * from each law's counterexample census (the starved-default lesson: a bare `for 5` caps
 * EntityId below the pinned entity counts and the check passes over starved universes —
 * knowledge-base/pool-lattice-genesis-premise.md §3); light pins for the small-census
 * laws, moderate for the Receive family.
 *
 * The Σ-invariant guards are CASE-WISE (0/1 pre-existing members at attach, 0/1/2
 * allocation keys at Receive — the order_received ceiling applied guard-side): every scope
 * here stays within the exact cases BY DESIGN.
 *
 * The LATTICE ROW (§8.5.3) discharges HERE since cut 5: kanban and demand publish their
 * pool-provenance laws (`poolProvenance` / `holdingProvenance`), so the mocks tie record
 * bindings to attach payloads and the genesis premise reaches them (at cut 4, before the
 * publication, the row could only discharge at the integration tier — that root now keeps
 * the composed-arc witnesses). Scope discipline: 2 of the OWN kind + 1 of each visible
 * kind; the companion needs the peers' attach occurrences in the universe.
