/*
 * DEDICATED integration root (DT-022 TQ-5, cut 6): the receive → PD.Create → RecordDelivery →
 * release arc END TO END against the REAL demand machinery — the distribute C/OP saga composed:
 * demand Create → Release → StartProduction (real chaining/effects; cycle legs vacuous), the
 * PD's CreateDelivery (ATOMIC with demand's RecordProduction — the same-module pairing fires
 * for real), then the line's own RecordDelivery close and the Release.
 *
 * SCOPING (honest): the ORDER module stays types-only in this cone (receiving never posts to
 * the order — the order-driven capture arc and the attribution fan-out are unit-tier
 * witnesses; composing order's real machinery would buy no new cross-module semantics for
 * THIS arc). Kanban/item/station ride their MOCKS (no machinery of theirs is exercised).
