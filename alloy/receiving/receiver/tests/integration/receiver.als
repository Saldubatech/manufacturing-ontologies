/*
 * INTEGRATION suite for the receiving module (DT-020 cut 4): the real receiving log composed
 * with the REAL demand + kanban stacks (item/station ride their mocks — solver
 * budget: the composed arc reads neither). Gate tier: the COMPOSED-ARC witnesses — joint
 * loads and the three-holder lattice companion against the REAL receiving + demand + kanban
 * machinery. The §8.5.3 lattice ROW discharges at the UNIT tier since cut 5 (kanban and
 * demand publish their pool-provenance laws, so the mocks tie record bindings to attach
 * payloads); at cut 4, before that publication, the row's discharge lived here — the
 * interim is recorded in knowledge-base/pool-lattice-genesis-premise.md.
 *
 * The ORDER module rides this cone TYPES-ONLY (receiving reads no order log); order-cone
 * value sigs are pinned to 0 throughout.
