module receiving/receiver/receiver_types

/*
 * RECEIVER — TYPES (DT-020; DT-017 four-file architecture). The receiving CAPTURE surface
 * (DT-014 rung 4): the Receiver is a mutable bitemporal document on the Order/OrderLine
 * pattern (§8.2 — MP ruling 2026-07-21), mostly INFORMATION RECORDING — its ReceivingLines
 * are determined by the receiving process, not by the Receiver's contents. First module of
 * the receiving/ domain.
 *
 * THREE SUBJECTS on the log spine — the Receiver, its ReceivingLines, and the
 * OrderAttributions (§8.3.3: the attribution is an ENTITY with its own log — the third
 * subject; procurement/order set the two-subject precedent). Composition is ENTITY-CARRIED
 * ON THE CHILD for the lines (the O5 precedent: `receiverRef` immutable, `linesOfReceiver`
 * derived) and RECORD-CARRIED ON THE HOLDER for the attributions (§8.3.1: the line carries
 * `sAttributions`; the attribution carries NO back-ref — held-and-ignorant).
 *
 * THE TWO LAYERS (§8.2 RQ-1 layer split): the capture layer (Receiver + lines,
 * mutable-while-live, frozen by the explicit Complete cascade) and the distribution layer
 * (ProductionDelivery, re-homed to operations/demand §8.1.2 — referenced here only through
 * the line's owner-carried `sDeliveries`, §8.1.3 P2). They meet at RL_RECEIVED without
 * conflict: the captured-facts cluster freezes there; `sDeliveries` stays append-only until
 * RL_DISTRIBUTED (field-scoped freeze).
 *
 * PUBLIC OPERATION SURFACE (DT-017 L9): the 13 kinds, the Reason taxonomy, and the read API
 * live here. Laws are named predicates in receiver_contracts.als; machinery + the same-module
 * pairing facts in receiver_implementation.als; consumers' unit roots open receiver_mock.als.
 *
 * NAMING (Occ ruling (c) + flat-namespace survey): model sigs carry the `Occ` register
 * marker; product surfaces use the bare verb. This cone includes the ORDER module's kinds
 * (AddLineOcc, CloseLineOcc, …) and DEMAND's (CompleteOcc, DistributeOcc), so the receiving
 * kinds take collision-free model names: CreateReceiverOcc / UpdateReceiverOcc /
 * CompleteReceiverOcc; AddReceivingLineOcc / UpdateReceivingLineOcc / AppendAttributionOcc /
 * RemoveAttributionOcc / ReceiveLineOcc / RecordDeliveryOcc / ReleaseLineOcc (the line's
 * `Complete([locator])` — the model name avoids reading as the order's CloseLineOcc twin,
 * and demand owns CompleteOcc; the PRODUCT verb stays "Complete"); AttachAttributionOcc /
 * RecordActualOcc / DetachAttributionOcc. Statuses carry the RV_/RL_ prefixes (the
 * DS_/OS_/PS_ precedent).
 *
 * REASONS: nine atoms are REUSED from this cone with the same semantics one module over
 * (RFrozen, RBadState, RForeignRef, RBadAllocation, RNotAttached from demand; RLineStarted,
 * RLineClosed from order; RWrongItem, RAlreadyMember from the pool; RPoolInUse, RForeignPool
 * from kanban); the receiving-specific atoms are declared below.
 *
 * MODEL SIMPLIFICATIONS (documented, not modeled — design doc §4): receiverNumber (identity
 * is the atom; the number is a runtime writer policy — the orderNumber precedent); notes
 * (occurrence payloads, never record fields — the order precedent); the pre-freeze RUNNING
 * received count (capture-window accumulation is service/UI convenience; the STORED
 * `sReceivedQty` is authoritative from the Receive freeze — §8.4.1: the accepted count is
 * final only there; the capture-window SET rides UpdateReceivingLineOcc); the put-away move
 * bundled in ReleaseLine's `locator` parameter (an ITEM-level move in the resources module —
 * the payload is carried, the move itself is the caller's composite leg, §8.2.1).
