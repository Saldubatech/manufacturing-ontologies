/*
 * DEDICATED root for the sReceived ACCUMULATE reading (the kit's denormalized-observables
 * obligation (a)) — the ONLY root that opens order_received.als. Unlike demand_reset's fact,
 * receivedIsAccumulatedAt is a THEOREM here (receiptAccrues + receiptReverses + genesis-zero +
 * framing), so this root CHECKS it (case-wise: ≤ 2 receipts, ≤ 1 reversal — the scopes pin
 * both kinds) and witnesses the ends, the compensated middle, and the reversal-first window. The kanban print machine rides the cone: pins as everywhere.
