module meta/subject_log/subject_log[Subject, Rec]

/*
 * WHAT THIS OFFERS A DOMAIN MODELER (DT-013): the SPINE of a subject's operation log — declare
 * your operation kinds extending `SubjectOcc`, and the module gives you the chaining law (every
 * operation reads the subject's REAL current record — refusals included) and the as-of reads
 * (`recordAt`/`startedAt`), so your module only writes what is genuinely domain: the kinds, their
 * guards and effects, and what "closed" means for your subject.
 *
 * Extracted 2026-07-03 (DT-015 Q5) from THREE hand-built instances — the InventoryItem log
 * (DT-006), the InventoryPool membership log, and the CardCycle lifecycle log — as their common,
 * SINGLE-SUBJECT core. Parameterized over `Subject` (the entity whose history this is) and `Rec`
 * (the Snapshot subtype carrying its mutable payload); each `open` gets its OWN log spine, so
 * several subject logs coexist in one model (like keyed_sum).
 *
 * WHAT STAYS DOMAIN-SIDE (deliberately — the surface would lie otherwise):
 *  - The KINDS with their typed parameter fields and `bindings`.
 *  - The reason-precise ADMISSION guards and the witnessing fact (per-kind violation sets cannot
 *    be parameterized — Alloy has no higher-order functions; copy the two-line witness idiom).
 *  - EFFECTS (per-kind record frames) and CLOSURE/liveness semantics (tombstones, rollover,
 *    never-closes — each domain's own; build them ON `lastTouch`/`recordAt`).
 *  - MULTI-SUBJECT kinds (the InventoryItem Split/Merge per-role records): this spine is
 *    single-subject; the II log keeps its bespoke `touches`/`priorOn[o, ii]` machinery — a
 *    touches-generalized spine is a NEW design topic if a second multi-subject consumer appears.
 *
 * Usage (the CardCycle shape):
 *   open meta/subject_log/subject_log[CardCycle, CycleState] as clog
 *   sig RequestOcc extends clog/SubjectOcc { ... } { bindings = subject + ... }
 *   fact MyChain { clog/chained }               // adopt the chaining law
 *   fact MyCommit { clog/commitAlwaysAccepts }  // v1 result policy, if wanted
 *   ... guards/effects; reads via clog/recordAt[s, t] ...
