/*
 * PATTERN:  ex16's tray stack REBUILT on the completed Action machinery — the end of the ladder:
 *           ex16 Model 2 had bare ops and made illegal logs UNREPRESENTABLE (discipline as fact);
 *           here every op is a full StatefulAction: pop-on-empty is REPRESENTABLE BUT REFUSED
 *           (recorded, with reasons), guards are witnessed, snapshots chain, and the state read is
 *           LOCF of records. Note the structural free ride RETURNS: the snapshot record carries
 *           Model 1's held `seq` as a VALUE, so LIFO is free again — snapshots give the log model
 *           Model 1's structures without Model 1's clocks.
 * UML:      command + guard + event store with mementos.
 * FP:       scan-carrying-state over a validated event stream; refusals are Left values that
 *           still appear in the output list.
 * USE WHEN:  the definitive self-contained template for a domain occurrence log (the InventoryItem
 *           build's shape): kinds + typed bindings, unconditional chaining, value-parameterized
 *           cores, witnessed guards/Effects, LOCF read, invariant-as-theorem, delta agreement.
 * AVOID:     conditional chaining (`committed[a] implies a.pre = …` — a refused action still READ
 *           the real state; a free `pre` lets the solver justify any refusal), and discipline-as-
 *           fact when you need the audit trail (that was ex16's deliberate simplification).
 * SEE ALSO:  ex16 (the same stack, both bare time models); ex17 (snapshot chains); meta/action/
 *           stateful; workbook design-topics/dt-006 §Build preparation.
 *
 * Neutral cast: the room-service TRAY STACK again (learn it once — ex16's cast).
