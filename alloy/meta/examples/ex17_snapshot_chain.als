module meta/examples/ex17_snapshot_chain

/*
 * PATTERN:  Snapshot-carrying occurrences (meta/action/stateful, the as-of-read pattern — DT-006
 *           build prep): each committed action records the state it read (`pre`) and produced
 *           (`post`); state-at-t is LOCF OF RECORDS (one reducer, no fold zoo);  guards read the
 *           materialized `pre` (field access, not prefix folds); domain CHAINING ties one
 *           action's `post` to the next one's `pre`; transition semantics are VALUE-
 *           PARAMETERIZED CORES witnessed per kind; and the domain invariant (balance ≥ 0) is a
 *           THEOREM derived from the guards — not a fact (the invariant role-change: enforcement
 *           belongs to guards once refusals are recorded). Punchline: a mini agreement theorem —
 *           the LOCF-of-snapshots read equals the delta-cumulative view.
 * UML:      event store with per-event state snapshots; memento.
 * FP:       scan-carrying-state: each event stores the accumulator it produced; read = last.
 * USE WHEN:  translating a rich mutable entity to the log world (the InventoryItemState recipe):
 *           many fields / mixed reducers / derived guards — snapshots collapse all of it to LOCF.
 * AVOID:     delta-primary logs for state with resets/couplings (the reducer zoo — see the DT-006
 *           build-prep analysis), and stating domain invariants as FACTS on the log (that bans the
 *           refused attempts the audit trail exists to record — derive them from guards instead).
 * SEE ALSO:  meta/action/stateful; ex15 (guards/witnessing); ex16 (two time models);
 *           workbook design-topics/dt-006 §Build preparation; modeling/two-time-models.md.
 *
 * Neutral cast: a guest FOLIO (running bill). Charge adds, Payment subtracts; a payment may not
 * exceed the balance. Opening balance is 0.
