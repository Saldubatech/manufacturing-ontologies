module meta/examples/ex15_guarded_action_chain

/*
 * PATTERN:  A guarded ACTION CHAIN over the reified log (meta/action, DT-006 Layer 1): concrete action
 *           kinds bind typed quantifier variables (`bindings` — the "∃ x such that …" prefix); guards
 *           are made EVALUABLE by the witnessing pattern (`admission = Accepted iff <pred over the
 *           bindings + pre-projection>`); and the state after a chain of actions is QUERIED by folding
 *           the committed log prefix (`committedUpTo`). Refused actions are recorded with reasons but
 *           contribute nothing.
 * UML:      command + guard [precondition] on a sequence diagram; the log is an event store.
 * FP:       state = foldl over a filtered event list; guards = predicates evaluated at each step.
 * USE WHEN:  an operation must be admitted/refused based on the state PRODUCED BY PRIOR operations —
 *           i.e., legality depends on the chain, not on a stored snapshot.
 * AVOID:     a free `admission` verdict (then the log can record impossible histories), or re-deriving
 *           state from a `var` trace (the log IS the state carrier — DT-001.03/DT-006).
 * SEE ALSO:  meta/action/action.als; meta/action/tests/action.als (existence projection);
 *           ex14 (event-sourced level); design/meta/action; DT-006 decision 2026-07-01 (bindings).
 *
 * Neutral cast: hotel room CHECK-IN / CHECK-OUT. The admission guard reads the pre-projection ("is the
 * room occupied just before my tick?"); double check-in is refused. Occupancy after any chain is a
 * projection over committedUpTo — no `var`, no World.
