/*
 * ex19 — THE SUBJECT-LOG SPINE (DT-015 Q5): the fastest way to give an entity an operation log.
 * Hotel flavor: a guest FOLIO whose record carries a running balance; two operations — Charge
 * (any positive amount) and Settle (must clear the EXACT balance; anything else is refused with a
 * precise reason). The spine supplies the chaining law and the LOCF reads; this file writes ONLY
 * the domain: the kinds, the guards (witnessing idiom), and the effects.
 *
 * RECIPE (what you copy for a real module):
 *   1. open meta/subject_log/subject_log[YourEntity, YourStateRecord] as log
 *   2. sig <Operation>Occ extends log/SubjectOcc { params } { bindings = subject + params }
 *   3. fact { log/chained and log/commitAlwaysAccepts }
 *   4. per-kind violation funs + the two-line witness fact (reason-precise refusals)
 *   5. per-kind effect frames on committed occurrences
 *   6. read with log/recordAt[s, t]; define YOUR closure/liveness on log/lastTouch.
