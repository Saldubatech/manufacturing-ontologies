 * from the committed Create/Delete log, with NO `World` sig. `Action` is abstract, so concrete kinds are
 * used. `Thing` is a root-LOCAL toy sig standing in for any bindable model element (in the live model a
 * binding is an Entity, a Quantity, …— anything in `univ`); the framework itself has no binding type.
