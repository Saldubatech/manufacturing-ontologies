module meta/action/stateful

/*
 * StatefulAction — the OPTIONAL snapshot-carrying extension of the Action framework (DT-006 build
 * prep, 2026-07-02): open this ONLY for action kinds whose occurrences record the state they read
 * and produced (the as-of-read pattern — open #3). The core `meta/action/action` stays
 * state-agnostic; this module is to it what keyed_order is to keyed_monoid.
 *
 * This is where the EFFECT gets a visible seat in the anatomy: the pipeline is
 *     admission reads `pre`  →  the Effect constrains (pre, post)  →  commit reads `post`,
 * and "the Effect of kind K" is precisely the constraint K's transition core places on the pair
 * (the witnessing fact: `all a: K | committed[a] implies kTransition[a.pre, a.post, …]`).
 * State reads collapse to field access — no folds over the prefix.
 *
 * `Snapshot` is OPAQUE here: a domain extends it with its state record (e.g. InventoryItemState)
 * carrying the payload fields + intra-snapshot invariants as facts on the record sig. CHAINING
 * (one occurrence's `post` is the next one's `pre`, per subject) is deliberately NOT stated here —
 * "the same subject" is a domain notion; each domain pins its chaining fact over its own occurrence
 * kinds, and must pin it UNCONDITIONALLY (a refused action still READ the real prior state; a free
 * `pre` on refused actions lets the solver invent a state that "justifies" any refusal). Snapshot
 * extensionality (identical fields ⇒ identical atom) is likewise the record type's concern
 * (values.als practice). NAMING: `pre`/`post` — `before`/`after` are Alloy 6 temporal KEYWORDS.
