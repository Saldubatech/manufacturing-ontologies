 * Minimal sanity for `Principal`, plus confirmation it is fully an `Entity` (identity resolves).
 * SAT = a witnessing instance; UNSAT (check) = property holds.
 *
 * DECISION #2 (NOT Scoped) needs no command: `Principal extends Entity` is a SIBLING of `Scoped`, so
 * `Principal & Scoped` is empty by TYPING (the analyzer flags the intersection as always-disjoint). The
 * type system enforces "global, never tenant-scoped" more strongly than any runtime fact could.
