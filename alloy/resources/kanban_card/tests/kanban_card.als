/*
 * Structural suite for the split KanbanCard + CardCycle model — SLIMMED with DT-015 Phase B: the
 * operational lifecycle moved to the occurrence log (tests/cycle_occurrences.als carries the
 * behavioral claims: guards, closure, one-live-per-card); this root keeps the STRUCTURAL laws
 * (identity, ownership, ordering, refs, the print machine) plus the log-composed card readings.
 * Premises are FACTS via the P1 profile in the cone (the à la carte ScalarPremises fact retired).
 * Machine pins: 5 State / 8 Signal / 8 Transition / 1 StateMachine (print only — the op machine
 * retired). 5 Int: the region ranks reach 8.
