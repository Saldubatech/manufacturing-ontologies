/*
 * KanbanCard + CardCycle — TYPES (DT-017 four-file cut, 2026-07-08; content consolidated from
 * the pre-cut kanban_card.als / card_cycle.als / cycle_state.als / cycle_occurrences.als):
 * the entities, the CycleState record, the status vocabularies, the reified LifecycleConfig,
 * the PUBLIC OPERATION SURFACE (the eleven cycle kinds + the Reason taxonomy — L9), and the
 * read API. Guards, effects, chaining, and the print machine live in
 * kanban_card_implementation.als; the published laws in kanban_card_contracts.als.
 *
 * SPINE (ported 2026-07-08): the cycle log now rides `meta/subject_log[CardCycle, CycleState]`
 * — the spine that was EXTRACTED from this log's hand-built original (DT-015 Q5). The kind
 * subject field is therefore `subject`; the alias `fun cycle` preserves every existing
 * `o.cycle` read (receiver syntax), so consumers and suites are unchanged.
