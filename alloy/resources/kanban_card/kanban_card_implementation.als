/*
 * KanbanCard/CardCycle — IMPLEMENTATION (DT-017 four-file cut, 2026-07-08; machinery from the
 * pre-cut cycle_occurrences.als + kanban_card.als, semantics UNCHANGED): spine adoption
 * (chaining + commit policy), the reason-precise admission guards + witnessing, the per-kind
 * effect frames, and the print machine. The lifecycle discipline (KD9/KQ-S1/KQ-S9) is the
 * ADMISSION GUARD: the canonical region order + the reified LifecycleConfig — a forward
 * operation may SKIP only INACTIVE statuses; TWO sanctioned backward operations: Shelve
 * (REQUESTED → REQUESTING) and ProductionFailure (IN_PROCESS → REQUESTING — DT-016 R8).
 * CLOSURE: withdraw (abandoned) or the successor's genesis (rollover — completed). Cycle
 * occurrences share the ONE causal Tick order with IIOcc/PoolOcc — the composition seam the
 * demand module reads.
