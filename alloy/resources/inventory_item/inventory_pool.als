module resources/inventory_item/inventory_pool

/*
 * InventoryPool — a Scoped aggregate of InventoryItems that all classify under ONE Item. It resolves the
 * tension between (a) an InventoryItem as a *homogeneous* amount of goods and (b) needing to discriminate
 * InventoryItems that share an Item but differ in attributes (lot, expiry, locator, …): a consumer
 * references a single `one`/`lone` pool, while the pool holds the discriminating *set* internally — so the
 * `one`-vs-`set` duality is NOT forced on the consuming modules.
 *
 * LOG-CARRIED (2026-07-02 — MP review; the v1 `var items` predated DT-011's one-carrier decision):
 * membership is now the occurrence-log pattern of the rest of this module — the entity is identity
 * only; the held set lives on `PoolState` records carried by `PoolAddOcc`/`PoolRemoveOcc`; the
 * current view is the LOCF projection `heldAt`. Homogeneity and same-tenant are now GUARD-derived
 * theorems (witnessed refusals: `RWrongItem`/`RWrongTenant`), not standing `always` facts. Pool
 * occurrences share the one causal Tick order with the InventoryItem occurrences.
 *
 * SPINE (ported 2026-07-17 — DT-015 R2, the last row of the Q5 refactor review): the membership
 * log now rides `meta/subject_log[InventoryPool, PoolState]` — the spine EXTRACTED from this
 * log's hand-built original (with the II and CardCycle logs). The kind subject field is
 * therefore `subject`; the alias `fun pool` preserves every existing `o.pool` read (receiver
 * syntax), so consumers and suites are unchanged; `heldAt` is a wrapper over the spine's
 * `recordAt`.
 *
 * Still v1 scope: membership only — no liveness coupling to members (a retired member is a
 * modeling question deferred with reservations). Inventory counts remain DERIVED, never stored —
 * the counting machinery is the metrics package (`resources/inventory_item/metrics.als`, DT-007);
 * a pool-scoped count cell lands there on demand. Consumers (KanbanCard, …) are NOT retrofitted.
 *
 * Future (not modeled): recursive pools (pool-of-pools or leaf items); default/back-fill attributes;
 * lock/unlock the set as a unit; reservations against the set.
