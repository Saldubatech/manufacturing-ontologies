module operations/demand/demand_contracts

/*
 * DEMAND — CONTRACTS (DT-016/DT-017). The module's laws as NAMED predicates — curated few and
 * strong. CROSS-LOG LAWS DECLARE THEIR CONSISTENCY CLASS per the kit matrix (adopted 2026-07-06,
 * MP): same module + Operation → ATOMIC · same module + Notification → CONVERGENT/NOTIFICATION ·
 * different module + Operation → CONVERGENT/OPERATION · different module + Notification →
 * CONVERGENT/NOTIFICATION · human-resolvable → RECONCILED. Deployment plays NO role.
 *
 * Demand ↔ kanban interactions are DIFFERENT-MODULE Operations → **CONVERGENT/OPERATION**, with
 * the CALL-FIRST saga shape: the caller invokes the CYCLE operation first (Accept / Shelve /
 * StartProcessing / CompleteProcessing / ProductionFailure), reads its response, and only then
 * commits the demand operation — whose admission GUARD is the saga's commit gate (it reads the
 * member cycles' CURRENT states). Consequences the model embraces:
 *  - IN-FLIGHT INTERMEDIATES ARE LEGAL (suite boundary witnesses): an accepted-but-unattached
 *    cycle, a started member under a still-RELEASED demand, a settled member before Complete.
 *  - CONVERGENCE IS THE CALLER'S: retry the demand commit, or COMPENSATE with existing cycle
 *    kinds (Shelve un-accepts; ProductionFailure un-starts). No new compensation kinds needed.
 *  - The COMMIT-GATE laws below are guard-derived THEOREMS ("a committed demand operation saw
 *    its members at the expected saga state"); the QUIESCENCE law (`demandCyclesAlignedAt`) is
 *    t-parameterized — witnessed on settled traces and watched at runtime by the law probe,
 *    NEVER a global fact (that would outlaw the legal in-flight states).
 *
 * The R7 withdrawal reaction is CONVERGENT/NOTIFICATION; the frozen-state dangle is RECONCILED
 * (surfaced by `retiredMembersAt`, never a violation — a suite boundary witness). There is NO
 * uniqueness law for the (Item, Source Station) identity pair (R1 amended 2026-07-06): the
 * collation policy — which eligible cycle joins which DemandItem, and whether multiple OPEN
 * items per pair are allowed — is the CALLER's, served by the `demandsFor` read.
