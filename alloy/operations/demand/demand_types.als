module operations/demand/demand_types

/*
 * DEMAND — TYPES (DT-016; DT-017 four-file architecture). The DemandItem is the
 * collection-and-collation shim between card-granularity demand signals and aggregate
 * production (DT-014 rung 2): an "Intent to Produce" a quantity of an Item at its
 * Production/Source Station. IDENTITY derives from (Item, Source Station) — but that pair is
 * NOT unique (R1 amended 2026-07-06: multiple DemandItems per pair coexist in different
 * states; whether multiple OPEN ones are allowed is CALLER POLICY, not a module law — the
 * collation decision belongs to whoever invokes CreateWithCycle/AddCycle). First module of
 * the operations/ domain.
 *
 * PUBLIC OPERATION SURFACE (DT-017 L9): the 15 kinds, the Reason taxonomy, and the read API
 * live here. Laws are named predicates in demand_contracts.als; machinery + pairing
 * enforcement in demand_implementation.als; consumers' unit roots open demand_mock.als.
 *
 * NAMING (Occ ruling (c) + flat-namespace survey): model sigs carry the `Occ` register marker;
 * product surfaces use the bare verb. Three kinds take collision-free model names —
 * `CreateDemandOcc`/`DeleteDemandOcc` (inventory_item owns CreateOcc/DeleteOcc in this cone) and
 * `StartProductionOcc` (the cycle log owns StartProcessingOcc; the name also carries the R8
 * Produce/Fulfill vocabulary). Statuses carry the DS_ prefix (the print machine's PS_ precedent —
 * the cycle log owns bare IN_PROCESS etc.).
 *
 * SEAM (R3, narrowed 2026-07-08): this module opens kanban_card_TYPES only (the four-file cut
 * landed); unit roots take the kanban MOCK, integration roots the real implementation.
 * inventory_pool rides that cone.
