module operations/demand/demand_reset

/*
 * DEMAND — the CONFINED ResetQty Σ (R3b: THE arity-4 entrant). Opened ONLY by its dedicated
 * root (tests/unit/demand_reset.als). FINDING (2026-07-06, solver-limits): even confined, the
 * demand cone CANNOT carry the keyed_sum fold — the transitive vocabulary (kanban + II + item)
 * fixes ~250+ atoms into every universe, past Kodkod's ~215-atom arity-4 ceiling. So the Σ is
 * stated CASE-WISE for the witness sizes (0/1/2 live members — exact) and left UNCONSTRAINED
 * beyond; the general fold returns with the spine's F2 fold-ergonomics work (or a vocabulary
 * diet at the kanban four-file cut). The runtime computes the real Σ without ceilings — this is
 * a solver-budget artifact, not a domain rule (R3b note).
